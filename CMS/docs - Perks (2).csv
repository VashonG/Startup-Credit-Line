As your startup grows, you can take advantage of scaled discounts on additional licenses, never paying full price for any Dialpad products. Learn more <a href=""http://dialpad.com/dialpadforgood"" target=""_blank"" id="""">here</a> where you can sign up under ""Apply"". Be sure to select “Kaped.io"" from the investor dropdown.

Startups are encouraged to submit a link to a Crunchbase profile, or a public news link outlining accredited Angel/VC investment. Companies that are currently enrolled in a trial of Dialpad and/or Dialpad Meetings, or that have ever been in a trial (without converting to a paid plan), still qualify for DFS. Startups that meet these qualifications and have up to 25 employees are automatically admitted into the program, while startups with over 25 employees may receive other discounts outside of this program—so startups of all sizes are encouraged to apply.</p>",10 Free lifetime seats for startups,,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/633d40f74c5a1931ffa47e94/633e6780f370b076091d0a33_633b1ae396dff45db003ad3d_dialpad-lockup-color-rgb.png,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/633d40f74c5a1931ffa47e94/633e6780f370b05f601d0a32_633b1bd66e150d2d559a78af_Untitled%2520design%2520(34).png,communications,,,,,
